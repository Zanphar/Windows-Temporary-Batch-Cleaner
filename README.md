# Windows Temporary Batch Cleaner (formerly, tmpcln-bat)

This batch file allows you to easily clean-up (remove) temporary files in various locations of a Windows PC. Yes you have the Windows Cleanup Manager--but it don't do all that this does things a slight differently, which is why "CleanMGR.EXE" was also included in the code of this file, to help automate many tasks at once.

# Does more have to be done?
Honestly, this was left alone for some years, and I'm not sure I want to revisit it or if I want to make an actual program out of it.

# What has it been tested on?
Windows 7, Windows 10 (Yikes,  I touched Windows 8/8.1 maybe three times in total, one being in a VM, others, on others systems.) and nothing else. You're more than welcome to do what you wish with it pretty much, license inside the file.
